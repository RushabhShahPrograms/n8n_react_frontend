1) Firebase console — create project & enable Google sign-in

- Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/ and sign in with your Google account.
- Click Add project (or open an existing project you want to use for testing).
	-Project name: anything (e.g., whg-test).
	-You can skip Analytics for now.
	-Finish creating the project.
- In your project sidebar, go to Authentication → Get started (if you haven’t already).
- Inside Authentication, open the Sign-in method tab.
	- Click Google and toggle Enable.
	- Save.
- Still in Authentication, open Settings (the gear icon → Project settings) OR go to Project settings (⚙️ icon top-left) → General tab. You’ll need the Firebase config later (under “Your apps”).
- Add Authorized domains (inside Authentication → Sign-in method page, scroll down to Authorized domains)
	- Add localhost (or localhost:3000 if prompted).
	- Add your production domain when you deploy (e.g., app.wholesomegoods.com).

2) Get the Firebase config (to paste in your app)

- In Firebase console → Project overview, click the web “</>” icon to register a web app.
	- App nickname: dev-app (or whatever).
	- Register app, then Firebase shows a firebaseConfig object (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).
- Copy that firebaseConfig — you’ll paste it into src/firebase.js.


3) Update your React app — dependencies and firebase init
 - Open your project folder in terminal.
 - Install packages: npm install firebase react-firebase-hooks
 - src/firebase.js (paste what you copied)
 
4) Add Login.jsx page (simple Google sign-in)
	- Create src/pages/Login.jsx:

5) Protect the Index route — update App.jsx

run app : npm run dev
